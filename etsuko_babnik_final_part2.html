        <dt>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</dt>
        <dd> I did not have any previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
            However, some knowledge of Python from 
            <a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=9&coid=37426">
                PROG 108</a> , helped understand JavaScript.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Did you use a template, or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</dt>
        <dd>I used 
            <a href="https://www.simpletemplates.org/simple-website-template-5.html">template 5</a>
             from simpletemplates.org for website. I used contact form from W3school.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</dt>
        <dd>Most challenging part of my portfolio was time and task management. 
            Sometimes, I spend too much time on things that can be changed easy in later stage, like theme of the website, color selection and background pictures. 
            Those took time from tasks that necessary to complete the website. 
            I couldnâ€™t estimate time. For example, 
            Usability and accessibility errors, validation errors, codes not working at all, code not doing how I intended, research to find appropriate codes. 
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</dt>
        <dd>Website became more complicated over time. 
            I imagined the web development was complicated. 
            The idea of web development overwhelmed me because I did not have any idea what is involved in it. 
            I assumed this class covered small portion of web development. 
            But topics we covered gave me some confidence, I would be able to understand more when I tackle them small pieces.
        </dd>
        <br>
        <dt>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</dt>
        <dd>When there are issues, keep moving on to next step if situation allows. 
            Asking help is also a great option but keep moving on till the help arrives. 
            Many issues can be tackled later. Fixing issue takes forever, and deadline may come and go.
